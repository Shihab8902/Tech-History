Camera Obscura was the earliest camera that was used to study optics i.e. how light can be passed through a tiny hole to project an image onto an opposite flat screen. Arab scholar, Ibn Al-Haytham was the creator of Obscura's which gave birth to modern cameras and photography."

Joseph Nicephore Niepce clicked the first photograph and called the process “heliography”. As technology was progressing, practical photography was started by Louis Daguerre in 1829 and colored photography in 1940. Digital cameras that utilized the charge-coupled device image sensor were developed by Steven J. Sasson in 1975. These are the most sold cameras in the present time and incorporated in devices like mobile phones, laptops, vehicles, etc.</p>

Twenty years later when researchers came across an appropriate technology, they decided to use itbull'sll's eye design. After modifying this barcode into a rectangular design that we use today, they started implementing it commercially in the 1980s and since then, the industry has expanded rapidly for scanning and tracking applications.</p>

Not only it connected continents but also shortened travel time and showed us the hidden and spectacular viewpoint of Earth. Since its revolutionary invention in 1903 by the Wright brothers, traveling and transport across countries has become a child's play. It laid the foundation of aviation taking it to the next level by developing jet aircraft and space rockets. It has made the world smaller and accessible to everyone and helps in import and export products from all over the world. Airplane experience has been changed a lot over the years by introducing perks like comfortable seating, wifi, online bookings and check-ins, extra baggage allowance, etc. It still has ways to go as aviation is continuously expanding</p>

                                      <p class="ancient-text-content">Did you know that electric cars have been around since the 1800s? Yes, it's right. Although they are considered as the future of motoring, they are not a new concept and have a long and storied history. Around 1832, Scottish inventor Robert Anderson designed the first electric-powered carriage with a non-chargeable battery. A few decades later, the first practical electric car was built by an English inventor “Thomas Parker” in 1884. The duration of the popularity of electric cars was from 1899 to 1908 when Henry Ford invented the “ford model t” that runs on combustible fuels and was a cheaper alternative. The 90s was a key turning point for modern electric cars and after making several attempts, a silicon valley startup “Tesla Motors” appeared and announced the production of electric sports cars with a range of 200 miles. In 2010, Nissan LEAF (the most popular electric car) was unveiled and until 2014, consumers had a multitude of choices for electric cars available in the market. In this age, electric cars are the best substitute for fuel vehicles to lower the carbon pollution that is increasing global warming every passing day.</p>

Before this, messages were sent through the mail that used to take weeks. On May 24, 1844, Morse sent his first message “What hath God wrought” through a telegraph from Washington to Baltimore that broke new grounds in the field of telecommunication. This was the first time electricity was used to communicate over distance by putting wires between the places. The first design of the telegraph used the electric magnet to push a pin-up and down that would make impressions onto a paper tape which would then be decoded to get the message. Commercial applications came into sight with the development of a unified system of telegraph stations. The invention of the telegraph laid the foundation of modern communication technologies like the radio, the telephone, etc.</p>

                                      <p class="ancient-text-content">The telephone is the most profound invention in the world of communication. It all started in the 1870s when Graham Bell executed long-distance transmission of the human voice through electrical signals. Initially, people used to communicate through direct lines across a short distance only. It was only after the invention of the transistor in 1947 that lightweight microcircuitry was introduced. Over time, several smart features like automatic redialing, audio quality, call number details, wireless transmission, and clear visual display were added that supplemented the basic design. It took years for the evolution of the telephone until it became the modern-day digital instrument. With the invention of the telephone, the businesses and social activities of people have become global.</p>

When the radio waves were discovered, Guglielmo Marconi began experimenting with the transmission of wireless signals and submitted his first patent in 1896. Many industrial nations started their radio broadcasts by the mid-90s which was the golden period of the radio. People could listen to music, sports, news, and other programs through the transmission of electromagnetic waves. It was an important invention because it broadcasted real-time information and provided live updates of the events happening around the world. Radio has massive impacts on the world as it was the original social medium away before social media emerged.</p>

First, all-electronic TV was invented in 1927 by a 21-year-old inventor “Philo T Farnsworth”, which he called the image dissector. He transmitted the first picture by rotating a beam of electrons onto a square piece of painted glass by 90 degrees. Television broadcasting began in 1928 and has co-existed for so many years, electronic TV sets eventually started to replace mechanical systems. The 1950s proved to be the golden age of television and color technology in TVs got popular in the 1960s. The era of high-definition TVs started around 1980 and created a heightened sense of realism through its 3D experience. With the invention of online streaming services, it is yet to be seen if traditional TV will survive or not.</p>

This invention was a turning point in transforming materials from a scientific interest to technological applications. Gradually, manufacturers did improvements and variations and LCDs grew bigger, and full-motion, flat screens came to light. The 1990s was the era of breakthroughs in LCD technology when researchers improved contrast and viewing angles and brought costs down. There are still many areas that need to be explored such as flexible and 3D displays and continuous manufacturing of glass panels. This system consumes low power and has applications in watches, calculators, instrument panels, and consumer electronic devices.</p>

                          <p class="mt-3 history-text">While taking a look back at the history of Microsoft Windows, we know that they have flourished through the ages to reach the modern version. Windows OS refers to a series of operating systems developed by Microsoft Corporation. Microsoft initiated the trials to develop windows in 1981 and used the na “e “Interlace Mana” er” for it. MS-DOS was the standard system for IBM-compatible computers. Bill Gates announced Microsoft Windows in 1983 while the first versi “n “Microsoft Windows” .0″ was introduced in 1985. Since then, it has seen nine major versions and Windows 7 was released as the latest version in the 25-year-old line of Windows Operating Systems.</p>

                          <p class="mt-3 history-text">In the old days, transferring data into your computer needed plugging in a zoo of cables, a connector, or a serial port. When USB was released in 1996, the idea was right there in its na “e “Universal Serial” us” which means as soon as you plug the device in the computer it works. Though Ajay Butt from Intel started its development in 1994 and released in 1996 the technolodidn’tn’t take off until the first iMac was released as a USB-only machine in 1998. It was faster than older serial ports as the data transfer rates were up to 12Mb/sec. With the advancement in technology, a new cable desi “n “Typ” C” is in use that is also reversible along with type A and type B.</p>

                          <p class="mt-3 history-text">Wifi is certainly the most popular expression used by people around the globe but who brings this technology to the world is an interesting story. Hollywood actre “s “Hedy Lam” rr” filed for frequency-hopping technology in 1941 that paved the way for the secured wifi that it is today. There are many patents linked with this technology but Vic Hayes is call “d “the father of w” fi” because he established standards to make wifi feasible. The first wifi system was the 802.11 standard that was accepted in 1997. Network cables were no longer needed to surf the internet at work or home and with a router or a dongle, the internet could be used wirelessly. Over the years, wifi technology progressed real quick and found its way into our computers, mobile phones, and even cars.</p>

                          <p class="mt-3 history-text">Bluetooth is the most popular wireless communication technology that has become indispensable to be used in many electronic devices these days. Jaap C. Haartsen is considered the sole inventor of Bluetooth, who released its first version on July 26, 1999. It was developed to build a connection between devices, and portable PCs or laptops over short distances. Bluetooth can link two enabled devices without needing any additional network equipment like rotors or modems which is why it was chosen to be used in mobile phones for transferring data. In recent years, Bluetooth has transformed into the Bluetooth smart system and expanded to link earphones, earbuds, wireless speakers, and hearing aids to audio sources.</p>

Two Denmark-born but Sydney-based developers co-founded the startup mapping company nam “d “Where 2 technolog” es”. In 2004, they sold the company to Google, which later turned it into Google Maps, which was the dynamic online map with turn-by-turn driving instructions. A few years later, Google added 360 degrees street-level views of houses, roads, and landmarks, and to this day, Google Maps remains the standard. Digital mapping improves as the world evolves, and so does Google Maps, so no one can say where we go from here.</p>

After the iPhone, all mobile phone companies started copying its design, and Apple CEO Steve Jobs has sold 1.5 billion of them until now. Armed with powerful features like iconic touch-screen technology, the lithium battery, the internet, and the WWW, it squeezed more functionality into one device. Apple also launched its online app store in 2008 that enabled people to download different software applications. Since then, several breakthroughs have happened, and Apple went on to over 29 updated models of the iPhone.</p>
